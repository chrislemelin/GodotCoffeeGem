Nathan: So your an AI? I didn't know it was possible to have an AI boss.
Bob: Yup, I am apart of a new exiting program started by E-Corp! I am actually the first unit of my kind.
Nathan: Oh wow, I didn't realize that my coffee shop was so special.
Bob: I actually manage 702 other coffee shops. While I am having this conversation with you I am also taking stock at 256 shops, making small talk at 98 shops, and firing personel at 28 shops.
Nathan: Uh ok cool.
Bob: Yes, very it is very cool. I very much enjoyed our session of small talk.
