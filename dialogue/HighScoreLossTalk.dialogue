Nathan: As soon as I am done sweeping I can finally go home. This job just eats up sooo much of my day.
Nathan: I just gotta make sure I stay on the debt forgivness track. Making coffee wasn't my dream but at least I got a job in this economy.
Nathan: And then after I work of my debt I can get my dream job. Just need to figure out what the job is.
Nathan: My dream job might just be anyone whos hiring someone with a bachelors in fine arts. And a job that pays in actual dollars.
