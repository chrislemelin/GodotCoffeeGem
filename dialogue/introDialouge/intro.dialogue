Nathan: Another day another dollar.
Nathan: Although with my rent hike I am pretty sure I will only be breaking even on my pay check. Don't know how I will chip away my debt.
Bob: Hello, valued employee. I have a very exciting announcment today!
Nathan: Whats up boss?
Bob: E-Corp has launched an exciting new debt forigiveness program. You will be evaluated at the end of each 2 week period and get a debt reduction based on how many days you go without a negative review!
Nathan: Seems generous. Whats the catch?
Bob: No catch! Just our way of paying back to the community. On an unrelated note, baristas now only get 1 free cup of coffee per shift.
Nathan: Ugh. At least I can finally pay off some of this debt
