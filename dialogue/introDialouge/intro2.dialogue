Nathan: Another day another dollar.
Bob: Hello, valued employee. I have a very exciting announcment today!
Nathan: Whats up boss?
Bob: We at Conglomerate Inc. has launched an exciting new bonus program. You will be evaluated at the end of each 2 week period and get a bonus of $500 if you go without a negative review!
Nathan: Seems generous. Whats the catch?
Bob: No catch! Just our way of paying back to the community. On an unrelated note, baristas now only get 1 free cup of coffee per shift.
Nathan: That bonus is a good as mine. I wonder what I should spend my bonus on, a vaction to somewhere with a beach sounds nice.
