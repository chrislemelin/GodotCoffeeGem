ShopKeeper: Hey, Nathan. How are you doing?
Nathan: Doing well, just finished my first day of work.
ShopKeeper: You're working at that BeanTown coffee joint right? I actually used to work at a BeanTown back when I was a D level employee.
I got some tools in the back that you might be interested in.
Nathan: That would be amazing, work is hard enough with these quotas I need to hit.
ShopKeeper: Just so you know I will need to charge you E-Bucks for these items. I also got a quota to hit.
Nathan: Fair enough, not like I can just spend these E-Bucks anywhere so might as well spend them here.
