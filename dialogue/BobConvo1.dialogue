Bob: So how was your first day of work?
Nathan: It wasn't too bad. Using this coffee machine was a bit weird at first but I think I am getting the hang of it
Bob: Good to hear! I have high hopes for you. My managerial software is telling me that you will be a hard worker.
Bob: Unlike so many other past employees, no one wants to work these days.
Nathan: Yea im not like other employees, I'm different.
