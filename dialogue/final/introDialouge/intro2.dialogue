Nick: Phew, only a couple of minutes behind. I've still got time to open up the shop.
Bob: Nick! Just the person I wanted to see.
Nick: Oh. Hi, Boss. You're checking in early.
Bob: Well, you know what they say. The early bird gets the worm. Anyway, I have an important topic to discuss with you. Your coffee production statistics this month have been below expectations. As such, I must regrettably place you on a performance improvement plan.
Nick: Boss, I'm doing my best, and I really need this job. I was really counting on this next paycheck for rent.
Bob: Then all you need to do is perform well during this next two week cycle, and the performance plan will expire! The daily required customer satisfaction quotas are included in the attached calendar. I expect great things from you.
Nick: Okay. I just need to lock in, and everything will be okay.
