Bob: Congratulations! You've exceeded our expectations so much that we would like to award you with this sticker as a token of our appreciation [img with=32 height=32]res://UI/highscore/starSingle.png[/img]. Unfortunately, it looks like I'll still have to fire you due to the end-of-demo clause in your contract.
Nick: Huh?
Bob: Please enter your name in the employee rankings for our records and consider working with us again in the future!
